My page is limited by the fact that the user can only enter up to 6 rows and columns, meaning that at most, 
only the distribution and association between 6 variables. 

There is also a min constraint of 2 rows and variables, as by definition to study the relationship 
between variables requires at least two variables. 


Problems with my code/implementation is that the user has to use the keyboard "up/down" buttons to enter the number 
of rows and columns at the very beginning to create the input matrix. Besides that there are no other implementation problems.  

If I had more time, I would like to add a features where the user can conduct different types of chi-square tests and conduct 
them on different confidence intervals and significance levels. I would also like to make the graph more colorful and allow 
to toggle for different statistics. 

The website works by doing several mathematical operations on user inputted data. Behind the scenes, the user data for each category 
and group are held in multiple array data structures. These data structures are analyzed by conducting several operations such
as the reduce() function to find the sum of the user data values for each category and group, division of array indexes to 
get the frequency, relative frequency, expected values, and chi-square test statistics. 
The sum of the group totals and category totals are used by Plotly to create a bar graph that displays the respective toals. 
The information from the expected data is used in tandem from the original user input to get the x^2 test statistic and the degrees of freedom. 
These two values are then used by Jstat 1- (Jstat.chisquare.cdf()) to calculate the p-value.
