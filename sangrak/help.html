    A Contingency Table is a table used to show the distribution of variables in rows and columns and study the
    association between them.
    <br><br>
    This page allows the user to study and observe the distribution and association between a max of 6 variables for
    each type of data set. The frequency (sum of each variable) is shown as a graphical representation.
    This distribution can also be analyzed from a variety of tables including frequency, relative frequency, and
    contingency tables.
    <br><br>
    It also conducts a chi-square test on the variables and produces a p-value based on a computed test statistic
    and the degrees of freedom.
    <br><br>
    You can view the steps and intermediate calculations in conducting the chi-square test through the expected values
    table, which provides an expected value
    for each observed value corresponding to its' associated variable.
