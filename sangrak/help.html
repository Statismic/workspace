    A Contingency Table is a table used to show the distribution of variables in rows and columns and study the
    association between them.
    <br><br>
    This page allows the user to study and observe the distribution and association between a max of 6 variables for
    each type of data set. The frequency (sum of each variable) is shown as a graphical representation.
    This distribution can also be analyzed from a variety of tables including frequency, relative frequency, and
    contingency tables.
    <br><br>
    The web page also conducts a chi-square test on the variables and produces a p-value based on a computed test
    statistic
    and the degrees of freedom.
    <br><br>
    The user is also presented with an expected values table that shows the long-run average values for each variable if
    the user had
    conducted the experiment over thousands of repetitions. This table is important in calculating the chi-square test
    statistic as the observed data is compared to the expected data to finally compute the p-value.
