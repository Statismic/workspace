My page is limited by the user having to know the population mean, population standard deviation and sample size.
It is not able to calculate the confidence interval even if one of these inputs is missing.

Problems with my code/implementation is it is very slow if repetitions is greater than 1000 and the graph is not 
readable with such high number of reptitions. The population mean is also not always centered

I would like to add feature where user can copy and paste their population set and it would generate a graph.
I would also like to add feature where user can drag the confidence intervals around on the graph and the page 
would give them a population mean and deviation that is associated with the new confidence intervals

It works using Jstat to calculate a normal value set from user input. Then it uses Jstat to calculate T value which is then plugged
into confidence interval formula to calculate the confidence intervals. All confidence intervals are stored in an array
which is used by chartJS to create the chart.
